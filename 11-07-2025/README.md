## Problem: [2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/)

- **Status:** ‚úÖ Solved  
- **Difficulty:** Hard  
- **Tags:** Heap, Priority Queue, Simulation, Greedy

### ‚úÖ Intuition:
At first I thought I could just use a single priority queue of rooms, sorted by their next free time.  
My idea was: always pick the room that is free the earliest, and if it's busy past the meeting start, delay it.  

I thought this would automatically handle everything, since the heap always gives the earliest free room.  

But I got wrong answers. I didn't handle the rule "use *any* available room at the meeting start time with the *lowest* room number."  

My approach forced unnecessary delays because the PQ only knew about "earliest free room" globally‚Äînot who was *already free at start*.

### ‚úÖ Explanation of the Solution:
**Key insight**: The problem specifically says:  

> If any room is free at the meeting‚Äôs start time, use the unused room with the lowest number. Only if none is free, delay the meeting.

‚úÖ To implement that strictly, we need **two priority queues**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **UnusedRooms** (min-heap of room numbers):  
- Contains rooms that are actually free at current meeting's start.  
- Lets us always choose the *lowest* room number among free rooms.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **UsedRooms** (min-heap of `(free_time, room)`):  
- Contains rooms currently in use, ordered by when they become free.  
- Lets us find which room becomes free the earliest for delay.

**Algorithm steps:**

1. Initialize all rooms as unused.
2. Sort meetings by their start time.
3. For each meeting:
   - Free any rooms whose end time ‚â§ meeting's start.  
     ‚Üí Move them back to `unusedRooms`.
   - If `unusedRooms` not empty:  
     ‚Üí Assign this meeting to the lowest-numbered room without delay.
   - Else:  
     ‚Üí Delay meeting to the soonest free room, adjust its time.  
4. Track meeting count for each room.
5. Return the room with highest meeting count (smallest number in tie).

‚úÖ This exactly follows the problem rules without shortcuts.

### üß† Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time:** O(M log N)  
  - M = number of meetings  
  - Each meeting pushes/pops from heaps of size N.
- **Space:** O(N)  
  - Tracking two heaps and counts for N rooms.

### üí° Solution (C++):
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mostBooked(int n, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        vector<int> meetingCount(n, 0);
        priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, greater<>> usedRooms;
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> unusedRooms;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            unusedRooms.push(i);
        }
        sort(meetings.begin(), meetings.end());

        for (auto meeting : meetings) {
            int start = meeting[0], end = meeting[1];
            // Free up any rooms that have finished before this meeting's start
            while (!usedRooms.empty() && usedRooms.top().first <= start) {
                int room = usedRooms.top().second;
                usedRooms.pop();
                unusedRooms.push(room);
            }

            if (!unusedRooms.empty()) {
                int room = unusedRooms.top();
                unusedRooms.pop();
                usedRooms.push({end, room});
                meetingCount[room]++;
            } else {
                auto [roomAvailabilityTime, room] = usedRooms.top();
                usedRooms.pop();
                usedRooms.push({roomAvailabilityTime + (end - start), room});
                meetingCount[room]++;
            }
        }

        int maxMeetingCount = 0, maxMeetingCountRoom = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (meetingCount[i] > maxMeetingCount) {
                maxMeetingCount = meetingCount[i];
                maxMeetingCountRoom = i;
            }
        }
        return maxMeetingCountRoom;
    }
};
```

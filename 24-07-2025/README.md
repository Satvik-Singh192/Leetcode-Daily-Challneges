## Problem: [2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-after-removals-on-a-tree)

- **Status:** ‚ùå Tried but couldn‚Äôt solve  
- **Difficulty:** Hard  
- **Tags:** `DFS`, `Tree`, `Bit Manipulation`, `Graph`, `XOR`

### ‚úÖ Intuition:

Initially, I was thinking about simulating edge removals by iterating through the `edges` array and manually removing each edge. I planned to compute the XORs of the resulting components using DFS for each removal. But that turned out to be inefficient and conceptually flawed ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt sure how to correctly form and track the three parts of the tree after two edge cuts.

With some guidance, I learned that this problem is better tackled by:
- Using a **DFS traversal to simulate one cut at a time**, and
- Running another DFS only in the **remaining part** of the tree to explore the second cut.

The idea of using XOR properties and subtree isolation was not obvious to me, but made a lot of sense once explained.

---

### ‚úÖ Explanation of the Solution:

**Step-by-step:**
1. Build an adjacency list for the tree.
2. Compute the XOR of all nodes (`totalXor`), which helps in computing the third component later.
3. Use `dfs1` to simulate the **first edge cut**. For every child in the DFS, pretend to cut the edge connecting it to its parent.
4. The child subtree becomes the first component. We store its XOR as `firstCutXor`.
5. Run `dfs2` from the parent node, avoiding the child subtree, to simulate the **second edge cut**.
6. In `dfs2`, try every possible second cut in the remaining tree:
   - Compute the XOR of that subtree (second component),
   - Derive the third using `totalXor ^ firstCutXor ^ secondCutXor`,
   - Update the answer with the score: `max - min`.
7. Return the minimum score across all valid pairs of cuts.

### üß† Time & Space Complexity:

- **Time:** O(n¬≤) in the worst case (since we may run DFS for each node's child subtree during second cuts)  
- **Space:** O(n) for adjacency list and recursion stack

### üí° Solution (C++):

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int ans = INT_MAX;

    // Second DFS: explore second cut possibilities
    int dfs2(int node, int parent, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& nums,
             int firstCutXor, int firstCutChild, int totalXor) {
        
        int currXor = nums[node];

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent || neighbor == firstCutChild) continue;

            int subXor = dfs2(neighbor, node, adj, nums, firstCutXor, firstCutChild, totalXor);
            currXor ^= subXor;

            int part2 = subXor;
            int part3 = totalXor ^ firstCutXor ^ part2;

            int score = max({firstCutXor, part2, part3}) - min({firstCutXor, part2, part3});
            ans = min(ans, score);
        }

        return currXor;
    }

    // First DFS: try each edge as first cut
    int dfs1(int node, int parent, vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& adj, int totalXor) {
        int currXor = nums[node];

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;

            int childXor = dfs1(neighbor, node, nums, adj, totalXor);
            currXor ^= childXor;

            // Simulate cutting edge (node - neighbor)
            dfs2(node, -1, adj, nums, childXor, neighbor, totalXor);  // Avoid neighbor during dfs2
        }

        return currXor;
    }

    int minimumScore(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        for (auto& e : edges) {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        int totalXor = 0;
        for (int val : nums) totalXor ^= val;

        dfs1(0, -1, nums, adj, totalXor);
        return ans;
    }
};
## üìö What I Learned:

- How to simulate removing an edge in DFS without actually deleting it ‚Äî by skipping traversal to one node.
- The importance of treating each DFS child as a potential subtree cut.
- Why it‚Äôs valid to only run the second DFS from the parent (not both sides of the first cut).
- Using XOR‚Äôs reversibility (`a ^ b ^ b = a`) to compute the third component.

These were all new concepts to me, and I didn‚Äôt arrive at them on my own ‚Äî I understood and implemented them through guidance and discussion.

## üß† Patterns I Observed:

When needing to split a tree by removing edges, a good strategy is to:

- Simulate cuts using DFS, and
- Use multiple DFS traversals to explore different parts of the problem.
- Avoid recomputation by leveraging structure already uncovered during the first DFS.
- XOR is incredibly useful in tree problems where values are to be tracked across dynamic partitions.

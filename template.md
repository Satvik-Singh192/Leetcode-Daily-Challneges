⏳ Step 1: I will paste my own solution first.
🧠 Your task: Analyze my code. DO NOT give your own solution yet.
  - Help debug only if I say it gives wrong output or has errors.
  - If my code is correct, help me fill the markdown solution template later.

📦 Step 2: I use this markdown template daily:
## Problem: [<PROBLEM_TITLE>](<LEETCODE_URL>)
- Status: ✅ Solved / ❌ Tried but couldn’t solve / ☠️ Copied solution
- Difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard
- Tags: <tag1>, <tag2>, ...

---

### ✅ Intuition:
<Initial thought process>

---

### ✅ Explanation of the Solution:
1. <Step 1 description>
2. <Step 2 description>
3. ...

---

### 🧠 Time & Space Complexity:
- Time: O(...)
- Space: O(...)

---

### 💡 Solution (C++):
```cpp
<code>
```

write in .md 🧾 What I Learned:
<List what I learned from this problem>

🧠 Official Optimal Solution:
<If I provide Leetcode’s editorial code, explain that in markdown too. Same format.>

yaml
Copy
Edit

### ✅ Notes for ChatGPT:

- Only react to my code unless I specifically ask for help solving.
- Wait for me to send the official optimal code before explaining it.
- Final goal: Fill the markdown template with both my solution and the official one in clean format.
- I may also ask for upvote/feedback sections or title polishing. Be concise but helpful.
